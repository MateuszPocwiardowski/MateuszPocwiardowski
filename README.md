# About me

## Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mateusz and I work as a Junior Frontend Engineer. I have 1+ year of commercial experience.

I started learning Frontend in my previous job, when I had to create an app for recording working hours. My former employer regrets this task to this day, but I am happy because I have a new passion which turned into a job!

In my spare time I train kickboxing and do all kinds of sports with my dogs, from bikejoring to dog sledding.
