Hi 👋 My name is Mateusz and I work as a Frontend Engineer.

I started learning Frontend in my previous job, when I had to create an app for recording working hours. My former employer regrets this task to this day, but I am happy because I have a new passion which turned into a job 👀.

In my spare time I train kickboxing 👊 and do all kinds of sports with my dogs 🐶🐶, from bikejoring to dog sledding.
